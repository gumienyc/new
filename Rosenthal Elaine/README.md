# Beauty in Purity
*Elaine* was painted by ==Toby Edward Rosenthal=={Q1610297} in 1874. The subject matter of this work is from the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, specifically the death of the character ==Elaine=={Q2984446}, who died of a broken heart when she discovers her love for Sir Lancelot is not returned. [^1] This poignant scene utilizes lighting to add to the tragedy of the scene. The figure of Elaine is idealized and streamlined. She is unnaturally well lit, with no evident light source. She is in contrast with the dark boat, the black cloaked figure steering the vessel, and the shadowy waters and landscape. Her beauty and purity are literally highlighted, her light shining even in death. Her pale skin takes on the texture of porcelain. Despite being exposed to the destructive force of death, she is unmarred. The viewer is invited to mourn the loss of such a pinnacle of perfection, soon to be lost forever in the encroaching darkness. The fabrics covering the lower half of her body and the gold accents of the table and pillow she rests upon shimmer, and the folds of the dress she wears cascade eleganty. This tragic story and visual account of her death captured the hearts of audiences, who similarly idolized and upheld the ideals Elaine represented. The emotion and overtone of loss in this work make the painting all the more impactful and memorable.


# Pre-Raphaelite Influence

The ==Pre-Raphaelites=={Q184814} were a brotherhood of artistically and ideologically aligned artists founded in 1848. Its members were incredibly interested in medieval subjects and culture, and were very concerned with nature and its careful and realistic representation in art. They believed in an art that was honest and spiritual, one that was connected with the world and the self rather than a soulless replication of previous forms. This brotherhood felt a need for reform in the practice of art making, and actively pursued a more naturalistic and wholistic art. 
This painting, *Ophelia* by Pre-Raphaelite Sir John Everett Millais, 1851-52, depicts another female literary character that tragically dies, the character of ==Ophelia=={Q1800888} from Shakespeare's Hamlet. [^2] She is depicted in the moments before her drowning, arms lazily cast out and lips parted. Flowers float alongside her body, forming an analogue to her body. The vivid coloration of the work was a consistent feature in Pre-Raphaelite works, as brilliant colors evoked a more lively art of the past, and served as an effective tool to break out of a perceived monotony in art at the time, which was so entwined with Renaissance and Classical tradition. The tragic female subjects of *Ophelia* and *Elaine* show an interest in historic literature. The subject of Elaine herself was a favored subject of Pre-Raphaelites because of her tragic love and loss, as well as her pure beauty. [^3] Both works show a deep attention to detail in the manner nature is depicted. Both works capture an approaching death and loss of beauty.

# Another Elaine

==John William Waterhouse=={Q212754} depicts Elaine in another imagining. In *The Lady of Shalott*, 1888, Elaine, soon to die, sails for Camelot. Her expression captures a sad exhaustion, foreshadowing her confrontation with tragedy. Its vibrancy of color shows Waterhouse's Pre-Raphaelite past. The title originates from a ==poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson=={Q2091538} of the same name. [^4] The variation in source material creates an interesting distinction in what the artists were interested in capturing. The loss of beauty is captured in the corpse of Elaine from Rosenthal, while Waterhouse is more concerned with her psychology, her resigned and tortured expression juxtaposed with the lights of the candles being extinguished before her. This work depicts an idealized Elaine in the storm of her emotions that Tennyson elucidates. She sails on a fruitless journey, alone and terrified, and altogether beautiful. 

# Arthurian Legend

==Alfred Lord Tennyson=={Q173869} was an author that created many Arthurian works of literature, inspired by the Legend of King Arthur. His works would be a source of inspiration for the Pre-Raphaelites. In ==Idylls of The King=={Q2227196}, poems dating from 1859 to 1885, Tennyson reimagined the legend of King Arthur, going in depth with specific characters, including one section titled "Lancelot and Elaine". Elaine is frequently equated with fairness and perfection, even called the "lily maid of Astolat". This idealism captured in Tennyon's written word was a clear focus of Rosenthal's *Elaine*  as well as Waterhouse and Millais works. The female subject of Elaine - and Ophelia in Millais' case - is upheld primarily for her beauty and perfection. 

"From forehead down to foot, perfect--again
From foot to forehead exquisitely turned"

Despite her beauty being at the forefront of this work, the tragedy is also amplified in her final moments. 

"'Him or death,' she muttered, 'death or him,'
Again and like a burthen, 'Him or death.'"

The description of her corpse laid upon the boat can be aligned almost exactly with the painting by Rosenthal. Her beauty and perfection in death were so vividly described that they demanded capturing in an image like *Elaine*. [^5]

"In her right hand the lily, in her left
The letter--all her bright hair streaming down--
And all the coverlid was cloth of gold
Drawn to her waist, and she herself in white
All but her face, and that clear-featured face
Was lovely, for she did not seem as dead,
But fast asleep, and lay as though she smiled."

[Idylls of the King: Lancelot and Elaine](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Idylls_of_the_King/Lancelot_and_Elaine)

The focus on the tragic aspects of Elaine's Death in Tennyson's work parallel the incredible darkness encroaching on Elaine's light. The sadness is felt in the departure of the white bird, the fallen flower, and the forlorn expression on Elaine's pale face. 


# Elaine Fever 

The poignancy of Rosenthal's work was felt deeply by contemporary viewers of the work. The painting's tragic tone and Elaine's beauty both struck audiences, resulting in the selling out of the *Idylls of the King*  following the public display of the painting as well as themed clubs and dances formed around the character, her beauty, and the emotions she inspired. The careful curation of a beautiful subject in *Elaine* was clearly resonant in audiences, who felt the loss of her beauty so personally that the painting remained in their hearts and minds far beyond the moment they laid eyes on the work. This public renown the work recieved highlights its success in capturing beauty and inspiring viewers to mourn a fictional maiden's death. The work speaks to human values of life, love, and pure beauty that viewers were transfixed by in their minds and hearts. The fevor with which the work was recieved with and idolized at the time of its creation and initial display can still be felt today. The work continues to capture audiences and inspire further engagement with the character behind the beautiful figure of the work. Elaine's beauty may have been lost in her story, yet our continual engagement with this piece ensures her beauty will live on.
